# Tone Slapper

Portable Windows application for replacing event sounds on supported Bluetooth audio devices. The current release supports JBL Tune 720BT.

## For Normal Users

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You do **not** need to build this project to flash your headphones.
> Just use the .EXE from the `dist` folder.

1. Download the ready-to-use app: [dist/ToneSlapper.exe](dist/ToneSlapper.exe)
2. Connect your headphones.
3. Choose a complete sound pack from [Custom Sound Packs](Custom%20Sound%20Packs).
4. Flash the sound pack.

OEM sound packs are also included in case you want to restore the original sounds and the official source is unavailable: [OEM Backups](OEM%20Backups)

## What Is What?

- **Tone Slapper** is the app. It runs on Windows and flashes sound packs to the headphones.
- **A sound pack** is a complete `.bin` file made for a specific headphone model.
- **A single sound file** is only source material, such as one `.wav` or `.mp3`. You do not flash a single sound file directly.
- **Build instructions** are only for developers who want to modify or rebuild the app.

## Features

- Converts WAV, MP3, FLAC, OGG, Opus, M4A, AAC, WMA, AIFF, AIF, and CAF audio automatically.
- Rebuilds the indexed mSBC prompt bank and all known integrity fields.
- Opens and validates existing compatible `.bin` sound packs.
- Uploads through the verified JBL BLE service after explicit user confirmation.
- Downloads and verifies the OEM English recovery sound pack before every restore.
- Falls back to the pinned OEM copy in this GitHub repository when the manufacturer download fails.
- Produces a single portable EXE with no dependencies on the destination PC.

The verified OEM recovery sound pack is saved beside the EXE. Build reuses that
copy when valid; Restore OEM always attempts a fresh manufacturer download first.
Unknown file sizes or hashes are rejected and are never trusted automatically.

## Build (for developers)

> [!NOTE]
> Use the pre-built .exe in the [dist](dist) folder if you just want to use the program.



Requirements on the build PC:

- Windows 10 or Windows 11
- Python 3.14 available as `python`
- Internet access for the first build to install pinned packages into `.venv`

Run:

```powershell
.\build_portable.cmd
```

The script creates an isolated local build environment and writes:

```text
dist\ToneSlapper.exe
```

Python, Bleak, WinRT bindings, FFmpeg, the LZMA encoder, and icons are bundled into
the EXE. The OEM recovery sound pack is deliberately not bundled for legal and portability reasons. 
The destination PC does not need Python or additional packages, the .exe is self-sufficient.

## Verify The EXE

```powershell
.\dist\ToneSlapper.exe --self-test .\self-test.json
Get-Content .\self-test.json
```

## Tests

```powershell
.\run_tests.cmd
```

The tests automatically locate the project root from their location under `tests/`, so the repository can be moved or cloned to any directory without changing test paths. They are development files and are not imported by the application or bundled into the portable EXE.
